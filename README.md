# Framework Documentation

This document provides an overview of each PHP file within the `framework` directory, detailing its purpose and its relationships with other files.

## PHP Files

### Controllers

#### agent_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages user agent information and related operations.
- **Relationships**: Likely interacts with `server_controller.php` for server-related information. Might be used by `view_controller.php` for user-specific rendering.

#### data_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Handles data operations, including storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- **Relationships**: Connects with `db_controller.php` for database operations. Possibly used by `request_controller.php` for processing request data.

#### date_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages date and time functionalities, formatting, and calculations.
- **Relationships**: Utilized by various controllers for timestamping, scheduling, or time-based operations.

#### db_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Controls database interactions, including CRUD operations.
- **Relationships**: Central to many operations, likely used by `data_controller.php`, `model.php`, and potentially other models for data persistence.

#### email_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages email sending functionalities.
- **Relationships**: Works with `models/email.php` for email structure and possibly `security_controller.php` for authentication.

#### error_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Handles error logging, reporting, and possibly error display.
- **Relationships**: Relates to `models/error.php` for error handling logic. Interacts with `view_controller.php` for error page rendering.

#### image_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages image processing, uploading, and manipulation tasks.
- **Relationships**: Might interact with `util_controller.php` for utility functions related to file handling.

#### node_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Possibly handles Node.js integration or related operations.
- **Relationships**: Could work with the `node` directory for external scripts or with `server_controller.php` for server-side integration.

#### request_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages HTTP and CLI requests, routing, and request lifecycle.
- **Relationships**: Central to the framework, interacts with many controllers (`data_controller.php`, `security_controller.php`, etc.) and models (`request.php`, `response.php`).

#### scrub_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Cleans and validates input data to prevent security issues.
- **Relationships**: Likely used by `request_controller.php` before data processing and might interact with `validate_controller.php` for additional checks.

#### security_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Oversees security measures like authentication, authorization, and encryption.
- **Relationships**: Works closely with `session_controller.php` for session security, `validate_controller.php` for data validation, and possibly `email_controller.php` for secure email operations.

#### server_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages server-specific operations, possibly including server environment variables.
- **Relationships**: Interacts with `agent_controller.php` for server context and might be used by `request_controller.php` for server-related request handling.

#### session_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Handles session management, including starting, reading, writing, and destroying sessions.
- **Relationships**: Likely used by `security_controller.php` for session security, and could be referenced by `view_controller.php` for session data in views.

#### text_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages text processing, possibly including encoding, decoding, or sanitization.
- **Relationships**: Could be used by `view_controller.php` for text rendering or `email_controller.php` for email content handling.

#### util_controller.php
- **Purpose**: A collection of utility functions that might be used across the framework.
- **Relationships**: Serves as a utility provider to various parts of the framework, including `image_controller.php` for image utilities.

#### view_controller.php
- **Purpose**: Manages the rendering of views, possibly including templating.
- **Relationships**: Interacts with files in the `views` directory, uses `text_controller.php` for text operations, and might reference `session_controller.php` for session data.

### Models

#### email.php
- **Purpose**: Defines the structure and behavior of email objects.
- **Relationships**: Used by `email_controller.php` to construct and manage email data.

#### error.php
- **Purpose**: Defines error handling logic or error objects.
- **Relationships**: Utilized by `error_controller.php` for structured error management.

#### model.php
- **Purpose**: Base model class or interface for other models.
- **Relationships**: Parent or interface for other model files like `request.php` and `response.php`.

#### request.php
- **Purpose**: Defines request objects, encapsulating request data.
- **Relationships**: Used by `request_controller.php` to manage and process incoming requests.

#### response.php
- **Purpose**: Defines response objects for handling output.
- **Relationships**: Likely used by `view_controller.php` or `request_controller.php` to structure and send responses.

### Views

#### forms/*.php
- **Purpose**: Each file in this directory handles a specific form or form-related functionality, like `404.php` for handling 404 errors, `form.php` for general form processing, etc.
- **Relationships**: Interact with `view_controller.php` for rendering and possibly with `request_controller.php` for form submission handling.

#### jt_load.php
- **Purpose**: Possibly handles loading of JavaScript or other resources needed for the views.
- **Relationships**: Might work with `view_controller.php` or directly with the client-side for resource management.

#### jt_post.php
- **Purpose**: Could manage POST request handling or related operations within the view context.
- **Relationships**: Interacts with `request_controller.php` for processing POST data.

#### jt.php
- **Purpose**: Likely the main entry point for view rendering or framework initialization, managing the overall flow of view operations.
- **Relationships**: Central file, connects to all other parts of the framework, especially `view_controller.php`.

#### tmp_start.php
- **Purpose**: Temporary or initial setup script, might be used for bootstrapping or testing environments.
- **Relationships**: Could be an entry point or setup file for development or specific scenarios, might interact with various controllers or models during setup.

This structure now includes more detailed relationships, providing a clearer picture of how each file integrates with others within the framework. Remember to update with specific details as you delve deeper into each file's functionality.
