# JT Framework Internal Documentation

## Introduction

This framework designed specifically for creating dynamic, responsive websites and web applications.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic URL Routing**: Manage URLs with both literal and regex patterns, allowing for complex navigation structures.
- **CLI Support**: This framework handles command-line interface operations for script-based tasks.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilize reusable components to build pages, ensuring consistency across applications.
- **Security**: Built-in methods for data sanitation and security practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Extend functionality through an event system, making the framework highly customizable.
- **Content Management**: Efficient preloading and management of content for better performance on dynamic sites.

### Core Components

- **`jt_request_controller`**: 
  - Handles all incoming requests, routing them accordingly based on URL patterns or CLI commands.
  - Manages the lifecycle of a request from initiation to response.

- **`jt`**:
  - A central utility class that initializes various controllers, manages configurations, handles URL generation, and more.

### How It Works

- **Initialization**: 
  - The framework is initialized via `jt::init()`, setting up configurations, security measures, and database connections.

- **Request Processing**:
  - The `jt_request_controller` parses the URI, matches it against registered routes, and decides which handlers should process the request.

- **URL Handling**:
  - URLs are dynamically generated and managed, allowing for easy navigation and SEO-friendly structures.

- **Content Preloading**:
  - Before rendering, content that's likely to be needed can be preloaded, reducing latency on user interactions.

### Use Cases

This framework is ideal for:
- Creating custom web applications with unique business logic.
- Building internal tools that require both web and CLI interfaces.
- Projects needing extensive customization in routing and content management.
