##### [jt_load.php](#jt_loadphp)
- **Purpose**: This file is responsible for initializing the framework, handling the lifecycle of request processing, and managing debugging and performance profiling. While it might not directly load JavaScript or other resources as initially suggested, it plays a crucial role in setting up the environment where such operations could occur.
- **Relationships**: Works closely with `jt.php` (the core framework class) for initialization, `view_controller.php` for processing views and adding responses, and potentially with client-side scripts for debugging output. It also interacts with error handling mechanisms.

  **Functions**:
  - **No explicit functions are defined in this file**. However, several framework functions are called:
    - `jt::triggerEvent('framework:before_init')`
      - **Purpose**: Triggers the 'framework:before_init' event, allowing for pre-initialization setup or checks.
      - **Parameters**: None
      - **Returns**: None
    - `jt::init()`
      - **Purpose**: Initializes the framework by setting up various components.
      - **Parameters**: None
      - **Returns**: None
    - `jt::triggerEvent('framework:after_init')`
      - **Purpose**: Triggers the 'framework:after_init' event after initialization, for post-init operations.
      - **Parameters**: None
      - **Returns**: None
    - `jt::process()`
      - **Purpose**: Processes the framework's responses, likely preparing them for output.
      - **Parameters**: None
      - **Returns**: None
    - `jt::wrapup()`
      - **Purpose**: Performs final operations before script termination, like triggering the 'framework:wrapup' event.
      - **Parameters**: None
      - **Returns**: None
    - `jt::$error->report()`
      - **Purpose**: Reports errors when an exception occurs during initialization.
      - **Parameters**: Error details including subject, additional info, and error object.
      - **Returns**: None

  **Fields**:
  - **No explicit fields are defined in this file**. However, it uses several global variables or static properties:
    - `$resourcePaths`: While not explicitly defined here, this could be inferred as an array of paths to resources which might be used in the broader context of resource loading, though not directly in this script.
    - `$MEOWt1`, `$MEOWt2`: These are used to measure the execution time of the script. `$MEOWt1` is set elsewhere (possibly in `tmp_start.php`) before this script runs, and `$MEOWt2` is set here to mark the end time.
    - `$doDebug`: A boolean flag to toggle debugging/profiling on or off, set outside this file.
    - `$xhprofData`: Stores the profiling data from XHProf when debugging is enabled.

  **Additional Notes**:
  - **Error Handling**: The script catches `jt_error` exceptions during the initialization process, reporting them through the error controller if available.
  - **Performance Measurement**: Measures the total execution time and peak memory usage, which can be added as a debug response if in testing mode.
  - **XHProf Profiling**: When `$doDebug` is true, it uses XHProf for performance profiling, saving the profiling data and providing a URL to view the results, although this is commented out for non-AJAX requests.
  - **Environment Change**: `chdir('..');` at the beginning suggests a change of the current working directory, likely to ensure correct paths for file operations or includes.
  - **Script Structure**: Despite its small size, this file orchestrates the entire lifecycle of a request in the framework, from initialization to wrap-up, which explains why it might not need to be larger; it leverages the framework's event system and other components for its operations.

This script's simplicity is due to its role in orchestrating rather than implementing functionality, relying on the framework's event-driven architecture and other components to perform detailed operations. It acts as a high-level controller for the framework's lifecycle, ensuring all necessary steps are executed in sequence.
